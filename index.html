                <p>The opening is classified under code B01 in the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings</strong> (ECO). The Scandinavian Defense, described in Scachs d'amor, is the oldest opening by black recorded in modern chess. The general goal of the defense is to prevent white from controlling the center of the board with pawns, effectively forcing an open game, while allowing black to build a strong pawn structure.</p>

                <h3>what is the london system?</h3>
                <p>The London System is a chess opening that usually arises after 1.d4 and 2.Bf4, or 1.d4, 2.Nf3 and 3.Bf4. It is a "system" opening that can be used against virtually any black defense and thus comprises a smaller body of opening theory than many other openings. The London System is one of the Queen's Pawn Game openings where White opens with 1.d4 but does not play the Queen's Gambit. It normally results in a closed game. The line can be compared to the Colle System but whereas in the latter system, the queen's bishop remains on c1, the London System develops the bishop to f4 before closing the position, providing a more flexible approach.</p>

            <h3>what is the queenâ€™s gambit?</h3>
            <p>The Queen's Gambit is the chess opening that starts with the moves:<br>
            1. d4 d5<br>
            2. c4<br>
            It is one of the oldest openings and is still commonly played today. It is traditionally described as a gambit because White appears to sacrifice the c-pawn; however, this could be considered a misnomer as Black cannot retain the pawn without incurring a disadvantage.</p>
